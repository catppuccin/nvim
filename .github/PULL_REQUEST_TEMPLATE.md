🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉 Here are some guidelines from us:
- Format code using [stylus](https://github.com/johnnymorganz/stylua).
- New plugin integration should be added in [alphabetical order](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim#integrations)
- Recommendation:
  - Create a topic branch on your fork for your specific PR.
  - Consider using [conventionalcommits.org's](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) rules for creating explicit and meaningful commit messages.
  - If it's your first time contributing to a project then read [About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on Github's docs.
