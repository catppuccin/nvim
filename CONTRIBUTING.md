## Guidelines

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

- Use the `.editorconfig` file (located at the root of this project) on your editor so as to "maintain consistent coding styles". For instructions on how to use this file refer to [EditorConfig's website](https://editorconfig.org/).
- Format code using [stylua](https://github.com/johnnymorganz/stylua). This keeps everything consistent.
  - Make sure that the project's `stylua.toml` file is used for stylua settings.
- New plugin integration should be added in [alphabetical order](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim#integrations)
